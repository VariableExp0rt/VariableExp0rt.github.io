Detection engineer, k8s enthusiast and all round container fiend. Also asks why(?) too frequently.

### More Information
Hello one and all, I am an information security professional with 2+ years of experience, currently dabbling in detection and platform engineering. My guilty pleasure is working with a LOT of data, and intentially destroying K8s clusters so I can understand how to fix them. I write a lot of regex, can frequently be found in Splunk, shitposting and retweeting other peoples shitposting on Twitter.

I started this blog to force myself to write about my experiences with new technologies in the k8sphere, whether it be building local clusters as a development and testing environment, or researching new ways to secure clusters from Sith lords.
